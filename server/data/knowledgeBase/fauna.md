# Fauna of Islamabad and Margalla Hills

## Overview
The Islamabad region, including Margalla Hills National Park, supports a diverse array of wildlife. The varied terrain of forests, hills, and water bodies creates multiple habitat niches for different species. Despite urban encroachment, the protected status of Margalla Hills has helped preserve many native animal species.

## Mammals

### Common Leopard (Panthera pardus)
The apex predator of Margalla Hills, with an estimated population of 4-6 individuals. These elusive cats primarily hunt at dawn and dusk, feeding on barking deer, wild boar, and smaller mammals. While rarely seen, their presence indicates a healthy ecosystem. They face threats from habitat fragmentation and human-wildlife conflict.

### Barking Deer / Muntjac (Muntiacus muntjak)
Small deer species with distinctive reddish-brown coat, named for their characteristic barking alarm call. Commonly found throughout Margalla Hills, especially in dense forest understory. They feed on leaves, fruits, and shoots, and are a key prey species for leopards.

### Indian Grey Mongoose (Herpestes edwardsii)
Medium-sized mongoose frequently spotted in both forested and urban fringe areas. Known for their agility and speed, they primarily feed on insects, small reptiles, and rodents. Their resistance to snake venom makes them effective predators of venomous snakes.

### Golden Jackal (Canis aureus)
Adaptable canid that occupies various habitats around Islamabad, from forests to agricultural lands. Omnivorous scavengers that help control rodent populations and clean up carrion. Increasingly seen at the urban-forest interface.

### Wild Boar (Sus scrofa)
Abundant throughout the region, these adaptable omnivores forage in forests, agricultural areas, and even urban fringes. They're recognizable by their bristly hair, tusks, and robust build. While ecologically important for seed dispersal and soil aeration, they sometimes conflict with human interests when they damage crops.

### Indian Pangolin (Manis crassicaudata)
Endangered, scale-covered mammal specialized for feeding on ants and termites. Rarely seen due to their nocturnal habits and declining numbers. Heavily threatened by poaching for their scales and meat.

## Birds

### Himalayan Bulbul (Pycnonotus leucogenys)
Common resident bird with distinctive white cheeks and yellow vent. Their melodious calls are a characteristic sound in Margalla Hills. They feed primarily on fruits, berries, and insects.

### Grey Francolin (Francolinus pondicerianus)
Ground-dwelling game bird found in scrubby areas and agricultural lands around Islamabad. Known for their distinctive call at dawn and dusk. They feed on seeds, grains, and insects.

### Red-vented Bulbul (Pycnonotus cafer)
Common garden and forest bird with black head, brown body, and distinctive red patch under tail. Adaptable species found from urban parks to natural forests.

### Blue Whistling Thrush (Myophonus caeruleus)
Large, dark blue thrush with yellow bill, often seen near streams and moist areas in Margalla Hills. Known for their beautiful whistling songs, especially at dawn.

### White-crested Laughingthrush (Garrulax leucolophus)
Social birds that move in noisy groups through the undergrowth. Distinctive white crest and continuous chattering calls make them easy to identify when present.

### Black Kite (Milvus migrans)
Common raptor seen soaring over Islamabad, especially near urban areas. Opportunistic feeders that help clean up organic waste. Their numbers have increased with urbanization.

## Reptiles

### Indian Cobra (Naja naja)
Venomous snake identified by its distinctive hood when threatened. Primarily active at dawn and dusk, feeding on rodents and other small animals. Despite fear from humans, they play important roles in controlling rodent populations.

### Monitor Lizard (Varanus bengalensis)
Large lizard that can reach up to 1.5 meters in length. Commonly found in rocky areas and near water bodies. They feed on insects, small vertebrates, eggs, and carrion. Often persecuted due to superstitions despite their ecological benefits.

### Russell ºs Viper (Daboia russelii)
Venomous snake with distinctive chain-like pattern. Primarily nocturnal and feeds mainly on rodents. Medically significant species that requires caution when encountered.

### Garden Lizard / Bloodsucker (Calotes versicolor)
Common agamid lizard recognizable by the male's color change to bright red-orange head during breeding season. Found in gardens, parks, and forests throughout the region.

## Conservation Status

Margalla Hills National Park provides important protected habitat, but several challenges remain:
- Urban encroachment reducing wildlife corridors
- Human-wildlife conflict, particularly with leopards and wild boar
- Poaching of certain species, especially pangolins
- Disturbance from high visitor numbers on popular trails
- Feral dogs impacting native wildlife through predation and competition

The Islamabad Wildlife Management Board conducts regular wildlife surveys and works to mitigate these threats through education, enforcement, and habitat management.
