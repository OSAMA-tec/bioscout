# Flora of Islamabad and Margalla Hills

## Overview
Islamabad and the surrounding Margalla Hills host a diverse range of plant species adapted to the region's semi-arid subtropical climate. The vegetation varies from subtropical dry deciduous forests at lower elevations to subalpine meadows at higher altitudes. This diversity supports a rich ecosystem for wildlife and serves as an important natural resource for local communities.

## Key Tree Species

### Chir Pine (Pinus roxburghii)
The dominant conifer in the lower elevations of Margalla Hills (600-1300m). Identified by its long needles (20-30cm) in bundles of three and characteristic reddish-brown, plated bark. These trees are well-adapted to the region's dry periods and occasional fires.

### Blue Pine (Pinus wallichiana)
Found at higher elevations in Margalla Hills, identified by its bluish-green needles (10-20cm) in bundles of five. More moisture-dependent than Chir Pine, these trees prefer cooler, north-facing slopes.

### Himalayan Cedar / Deodar (Cedrus deodara)
Sacred tree in the region with a distinctive pyramidal shape and horizontal branches. Can grow to impressive heights (40-50m) and lives for several centuries. The wood is highly valued for its durability and aromatic qualities.

### Phulai (Acacia modesta)
Drought-resistant, small to medium-sized tree common in the lower hills. Features small thorns and pale yellow, fragrant flowers that bloom in spring. Its wood is used for agricultural tools, and the tree provides valuable fodder during dry periods.

### Wild Olive / Kahu (Olea cuspidata)
Evergreen tree with small, leathery leaves and small edible fruits. Highly resistant to drought and often found on rocky slopes. Has traditional medicinal uses, and its hard, durable wood is valued for crafting.

### Himalayan Musk Rose (Rosa brunonii)
A climbing rose species native to the region, featuring fragrant white flowers that bloom profusely in spring. Found along forest edges and in clearings throughout Margalla Hills.

## Shrubs and Smaller Plants

### Sanatha (Dodonaea viscosa)
Drought-resistant shrub with sticky leaves, common on disturbed slopes. Plays an important role in preventing soil erosion on degraded hillsides.

### Bhekar (Justicia adhatoda)
Medicinal shrub with large leaves and white flowers, traditionally used for respiratory conditions. Common in the understory of forested areas.

### Wild Pomegranate (Punica granatum)
Found in scattered locations, produces small, tart fruits. The wild variety has smaller fruits than cultivated types but is more drought-resistant.

### Lantana (Lantana camara)
An invasive shrub with colorful flowers that has become widespread in disturbed areas. While problematic ecologically, it does provide nectar for butterflies and cover for small wildlife.

## Seasonal Wildflowers

Spring (March-April) brings numerous wildflowers to the hills:
- Wild violets (Viola species)
- Himalayan primroses (Primula species)
- Wild geraniums (Geranium species)
- Buttercups (Ranunculus species)

These ephemeral plants complete their flowering before the intense summer heat arrives.

## Conservation Concerns

Several plant species in the Margalla Hills are facing pressure from:
- Urban development encroaching on natural areas
- Over-collection of medicinal plants
- Climate change altering flowering and fruiting patterns
- Invasive species outcompeting native plants

The Islamabad Wildlife Management Board and local conservation organizations are working to document and preserve the region's plant diversity through habitat protection and community education programs.
